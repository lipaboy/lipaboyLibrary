Ideas:

1) Create container like ListOfVectors with iterators and so that.
	- But maybe list< vector<bool> > is enough. Necessary to think this moment.
	- Year, you only need to write wrapper around it with iterators.
	- You need it in PseudoRandomSequences project (to storage big sequence)

2) (Stream) Write SelectMany(v -> v.ToWords).GroupBy(v -> v).ToDictionary(v -> v.count)
	to count the frequency of words in any text.

Global TODOs:

1) (Interval), (Comparable) write TODOs for them.

2) Write instruction to use my library

3) (Stream) realize the merging streams :
	Stream(vector).merge(Stream(vector)) | sum()

Local TODOs:

1) (LongNumber) Write division properly.

2) (FixedPrecisionNumber) write tests for comparing numbers

Think about:

1) I would like to add union interval and segment like the entire object (e.g. [-2, 3) U (5, +inf) ).
	- May be work with "<", "<=" symbols (from C++ STL). like container.add(5, "<=");
	- Answer: I think you need to create wrapper around Set<T> 
		because it cannot contain the function (contain), 
		or if so then wrapper will inherit from Interface IPlenty
	- What do I need the interface IPlenty for? 
		May be combine such actions like do smth over collection 
		by pattern like plenty language (set theory language). 
		Like do smth over the whole collection accept this set (plenty).
