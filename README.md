# lipaboyLibrary
some useful functions for work (C++)

1) I don't know how distribute my functions (intervalFuncs and maths) between namespaces. For example, LipaboyLib::Maths::Point2D or LipaboyMaths::Point2d

4)  Add new two parameters to Interval (RightComparison and LeftComparison). They intuitevly clear and undestandly but not obviously. May be need some instructions or help for it.

5) Perfomance 

6) Testing
